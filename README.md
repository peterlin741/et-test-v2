# Example Custom Template Repository
## Description
This repository is an example Custom Template Repository that can be used with the Cloud Code plugins for VSCode and IntelliJ. To see detailed infomration about how to work with template repositories, visit our [documentation page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osOg8ch_b2F_eOGJzKsutPUbLeQCKO96Llq1v5DQ8j4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Contents
### .cctemplate
The .cctemplate file belongs in the root of your project. This file describes the contents of your repository so that Cloud Code knows where to look for your templates. It should look something like the following:
```
{
    "metadata": {
        "version": "1"
    },
    "templates": [
        {
            "path": "path/to/my/template",
            "name": "My Template",
            "description": "This template helps you create something amazing!",
            "languages": ["lang-1", "lang-2", "lang-3", ...]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
There is an example .cctemplate in the root directory of this repository that you can review.

### hello-world
A sample golang template. You can see an entry for this template in the .cctemplate file.
